AnonBox
=========

Anonymous feedback made easy. Create a profile, share the link on your social media, and have friends and colleagues drop things into your custom made boxes.

AnonBox is built with an Angular 4 Client and a Node/Express API. The client is built with Angular CLI. The API is being developed to be easily deployable to Heroku by specifying the /anonbox-server/ folder as a git subtree when you push.
